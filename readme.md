### Live Version

Currently working on making this live on heroku!

### Description

This is a React.js/Next.js app for searching a database of dishes from nearby restaurants based on your specific dietary requirments.

### Data Sources

I collected the data myself from nearby restaurants in my neighborhood. I then categorized them and created my own api to access the data.

### Functionality


Search for dishes by name, description, gluten free, vegetarian or vegan to view dishes data which are connected to the restaurants where they come from. 

Users will eventually be able to have their own profile set up that includes all the dishes they have saved

### Technologies
Preffered Dishes will be a web application that will be built using
Front-End: React Next js Tailwind css
Back-End: Node.js Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL
